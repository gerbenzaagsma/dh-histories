In recent years, interest in the history of the digital humanities has grown. The 9th dhiha conference at the German Historical Institute Paris from 23-25 October 2024 will connect to this growing interest. It will explore the overlooked history of digital history from different perspectives and emphasize the importance of understanding the field’s past by examining historical developments, methods, and research gaps. The aim is to highlight past achievements and offer a critical perspective on the evolution of digital history, challenging the rhetoric of novelty that often surrounds it.
